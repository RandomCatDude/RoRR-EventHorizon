# Event Horizon

This mod is a faithful direct recreation of the official Typhoon difficulty that was going to be in RoRR.

* Massively increased initial difficulty scale
* Elite spawn chance starts maxed out (at 80%)
* Global +15% increase to enemy movement speed, attack speed, and cooldown reduction
* Time scaling and Director point scaling is doubled from Monsoon
* Loop-exclusive enemies spawn pre-loop
* Enemy Gold and Exp drops are reduced by 30%
* Not fun
* It fucking sucks

Thanks to Winslow for the selection sound.
